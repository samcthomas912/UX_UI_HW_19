            <div class = "bio"><p>Hi, and thanks for visiting! I am currently a math teacher aspiring to juump into the UX/UI Design field. I love the problem solving required to create an effective design. I am intrigued while analyzing the data pulled from user research, and am eager to rise to the challenge when it reveals a problem we may have initially overlooked. I constantly seek out different perspectives to supplement and strengthen my own views, and therefore excel in collaborative team environments, as they provide me a chance to see how others tackle issues and allow me to devleop as a designer.
 
                <br><br>Before teaching math, I was able to experience the web design world with a 4 year internship at Perfect Sense, where I was introduced to the process of redesigning websites. Although I primarily focused on content management, I had an interest in Product Management and UX/UI Design. Desiring to learn more, I enrolled in the UX/UI Bootcamp at George Washington University where for 24 weeks I learned how to design and had hands on experience with the process of designing apps and websites.
                 
                <br><br>I am always looking to learn something new, and being the specialist I am, when I encounter something I don't know or am unfamiliar with, I am driven to not only learn about it, but also to become a master. Having a background in math, I am a natural problem solver who thrives in finding answers to complex problems. I always look for opportunities to use my mixed backgrounds in art and math to apply creativity to the problem solving method, and I have found that UX/UI Design is an ideal platform to utilize my skills.</p></div>
